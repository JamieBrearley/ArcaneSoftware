            <h1>The truth about <span>website builders</span></h1>
            <p>Clients who have attempted to construct their own company website frequently contact Arcane Software. It's easy to see why individuals try constructing a website for themselves when there are so many choices available that claim to make it "simple." However, there are several reasons why you should avoid using a DIY website builder like Squarespace or Wix.</p>
            <p>Let's start with the most important one. But if you build it yourself, you will save money.</p>
            <p>We'll go over this in more detail later on in SEO, but in short, a website builder website will not be able to compete with your rivals and will most likely not be discovered at all. When you evaluate the true value of an inexperienced site design, you'll realise that it's more about missed opportunities than anything else.</p>

            <h2>Quality</h2>
            <p>It may be quick to create a website, but will it appear professional and, more importantly, will it function the way you desire while promoting your organisation? Perception is important, and having a professional-looking website is essential if you want to attract clients and outperform your competition.</p>
            <p>A website builder might be quick and easy, getting you off the ground. However the site will undoubtedly seem ordinary, and unless that's a positive in your industry, you won't be excited to show it off to your clients.</p>

            <h2>Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)</h2>
            <p>Everything is made easier with website builders. Isn't it fantastic?  It may make the design simpler by concealing the code, but it confuses Google to no end. What is the significance of this? Google, on the other hand, prefers well-coded and well-structured websites. It's how it interprets the data on your website. Your website might have the finest design in the world, but if the coding isn't up to par, it's as if it doesn't exist in Google's eyes.</p>
            <p>All of Arcane Software's websites adhere to the <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/40349?hl=en" target="_blank" title='Google-friendly site'>Google standards</a>. Our objective is to become a premier practitioner of SEO by utilising ethical techniques while being completely transparent.</p>
