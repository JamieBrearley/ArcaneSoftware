            <h1>The truth about <span class="fancy">website builders</span></h1>
            <p>Clients who have attempted to construct their own company website frequently contact Arcane Software. It's easy to see why individuals try constructing a website for themselves when there are so many choices available that claim to make it "simple." However, there are several reasons why you should avoid using a DIY website builder like Squarespace or Wix.</p>

            <h2>Financial Impact</h2>
            <p>Let's start with the most important one. But if you build it yourself, you will save money.</p>
            <p>We'll go over this in more detail later on in SEO, but in short, a website builder website will not be able to compete with your rivals and will most likely not be discovered at all. When you evaluate the true value of an inexperienced site design, you'll realise that it's more about missed opportunities than anything else.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Quality</h2>
            <p>It may be quick to create a website, but will it appear professional and, more importantly, will it function the way you desire while promoting your organisation? Perception is important, and having a professional-looking website is essential if you want to attract clients and outperform your competition.</p>
            <p>A website builder might be quick and easy, getting you off the ground. However the site will undoubtedly seem ordinary, and unless that's a positive in your industry, you won't be excited to show it off to your clients.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)</h2>
            <p>Everything is made easier with website builders. Isn't it fantastic?  It may make the design simpler by concealing the code, but it confuses Google to no end. What is the significance of this? Google, on the other hand, prefers well-coded and well-structured websites. It's how it interprets the data on your website. Your website might have the finest design in the world, but if the coding isn't up to par, it's as if it doesn't exist in Google's eyes.</p>
            <p>All of Arcane Software's websites adhere to the <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/40349?hl=en" target="_blank" title='Google-friendly site'>Google standards</a>. Our objective is to become a premier practitioner of SEO by utilising ethical techniques while being completely transparent.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Accessability</h2>
            <p>As we discussed in SEO, keeping the design simpler while hiding the code from the owner causes the code to become knotted and complex. Accessibility tools and services (such as screen readers) have trouble interpreting most of this code, resulting in unexpected outcomes and dissatisfied consumers. This is particularly detrimental to industries that cater to disabled people.</p>
            <p>We know and understand how screen readers read and comprehend code at Arcane Software, so we can optimise and work with these tools and services to ensure that everyone, regardless of visual or cognitive impairment, has a positive experience on your site.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Site Management</h2>
            <p>If you create a website with a web builder, you must host it on their servers. It won't let you export it and put it somewhere else. If you go with the free option, their name will display in the domain address (which is plainly unprofessional), and if you use your own domain, you will be charged a hosting cost. In either scenario, you're enslaved to a system over which you have no control and which, over time, may cost you as much to maintain as employing a <a href="../creation/web_design.php">professional web designer</a>.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Ownership</h2>
            <p>When Arcane Software hands over their custom-built website to you, it becomes your property. The material, the information, the modules, and the graphics are all yours. This not only gives you the flexibility you'll need to operate the site in the future, but it also gives you complete control over every part of it.</p>
            <p>When you use a website builder to create a website, it's essentially impractical to do anything else with it. You're in a bind. It's quite tough to take your site and its content away if you surpass it and want more control. You'd want to convert your Wix website into something else. You'll have to start all over again, which would be discouraging.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Efficiency</h2>
            <p>Building a beautiful website is difficult and time-consuming. Instead of wasting time on a website, you should concentrate on your customers, employees, and promotion. There's a reason why there are so many professional web development companies: businesses require well-designed, meticulously created websites and that requires professionals.</p>
