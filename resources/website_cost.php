            <h1>The <span class="fancy">Cost</span> of Web Solutions</h1>
            <p class="overline">Transparency and trust are essential in business partnerships, therefore we make sure our clients know exactly what they're paying for and how we arrive at our prices.</p>
            <p>How much does a website cost is one of the most often asked questions. Take a seat because we're going to try to answer it. Because every company is distinct and has various aims, determining how much a website costs is mainly determined by what the company wants, needs, and expects from their site. Consider the following examples:</p>

            <div class="iconBlockWrapper">
                <div id="flyer" class="iconBlock">
                    <i class="fas fa-book-open"></i>
                    <h5>Flyer</h5>
                    <hr>
                    <p><strong>~$1,000 - ~$5,000</strong></p>
                    <p>Website only for customers to obtain information. Does not include any forms, intended to display information with styling and animations, typically used for Patreon services, weddings and other events.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="marketing" class="iconBlock">
                    <i class="fas fa-comment-dollar"></i>
                    <h5>Marketing</h5>
                    <hr>
                    <p><strong>~$3,000 - ~$7,500</strong></p>
                    <p>Website to attract new customers by promoting your services and/or products. Includes forms for customer inquires and other desired information, results are emailed.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="dataStorage" class="iconBlock">
                    <i class="fas fa-comments-dollar"></i>
                    <h5>Data Storage</h5>
                    <hr>
                    <p><strong>~$5,000 - ~$15,000</strong></p>
                    <p>Website designed to promote your product and services while being able to capture large amounts of data via forms, surveys, etc. Results are stored locally in a database.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="ecommerce" class="iconBlock">

                    <h5>eCommerce</h5>
                    <hr>
                    <p><strong>~$10,000+</strong></p>
                    <p>Allows your site to integrate with other services, include a payment gateway and can storage large amounts of data in a database.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>The larger the needs, as with other service-based businesses, the longer it takes to perform the task and, as a result, the higher the price. Similarly, as the number of pages necessary grows, so does the amount of web design and development required.</p>
            <p>This page attempts to be as transparent as possible by breaking out how we do what we do.</p>

            <h2>Is it possible for a website to be both cheap and effective?</h2>
            <p>
                The online industry is, without a doubt, competitive, and obtaining new clients from competitors is becoming increasingly difficult. Any website that wishes to stand out in the internet world must be both useful and appealing to the eye. To be effective, a company's website must be easily accessible, whether through Google search or <a href="../marketing/social_media.php">social media</a>, and it must convert visitors into engaged customers.</p>
            <p>
                A low-cost website is that way for a reason. It's a measure of how much time, effort, and money went into a project. The less expensive the site and the fewer hours invested, the less successful it will be. Any low-cost product or service goes through the same procedure. Research suggests that the less expensive a website is, the less effective it is.</p>
            <p>
                It's also worth discussing the possibility of doing it yourself. If you're starting a new business and need to save money, website builders like Wix and Squarespace are viable choices. We urge that you read our article <a href="truth_about_site_builders.php"><i>'The Truth About Site Builders'</i></a> before going down this road.</p>
            <p>
                When you engage <a href="http://www.ArcaneSoftware.com.au">Arcane Software</a>, you're entrusting us with the task of creating a website that turns visitors into customers. This is also true if you engage us to handle your <a href="../marketing/digital_marketing.php">advertising and marketing</a>. We charge for our time and the resources we use to develop a website that looks great, functions well, and generates a profit for you. Our estimates are dependent on how much time we intend to devote to your web project. From calls to action, <a href="../creation/graphic_design.php">graphics</a>, and functionality to continuing marketing, third-party integrations, and design, we examine every area of your company demands.</p>

            <h2>The Essentials</h2>
            <div class="iconBlockWrapper">
                <div class="iconBlock">
                    <i class="fas fa-home"></i>
                    <h5>Domain Name</h5>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Popular companies such as <a href="https://au.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy</a> and <a href="https://www.crazydomains.com.au/">Crazy Domains</a> charge between <strong>$15 - $50 each year</strong>. Although, a valid ABN is required in order to acquire a .com.au domain name.</p>
                    <p>
                        With every connected transaction, Arcane Software provides free DNS and domain maintenance. Assisting our customers with this low maintenance yet complex task.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="iconBlock">
                    <i class="fas fa-plug"></i>
                    <h5>Hosting</h5>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Your website must be hosted online in order for others to view it. For your convenience, Arcane Software hosts its services on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Which allows us to provide customers a 99.99% monthly uptime percentage. </p>
                    <p>
                        Our hosting service is priced as per requirement but always includes weekly site backups and server maintenance. <a href="#flyer">Flyer</a> is charged at <strong>only $75 per year</strong>, <a href="#marketing">Marketing</a> is charged at <strong>$200 per year</strong> and larger sites such as <a href="#dataStorage">Data Storage</a> and <a href="#ecommerce">eCommerce</a> start at <strong>$350 per year</strong>.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Text, Photos, Videos and Graphics</h2>
            <p>A website is nothing more than an empty page without content. While simple design is appealing, an empty page will not attract customers. Content reigns supreme. Text and graphics are, without a doubt, the most important aspects of any website. In some ways, many of the world's most appealing and greatest websites are similar in that they've all struck the ideal mix of interesting content.</p>
            <p>We understand that every business is unique, therefore we'll have a range of content on available, including both photos and text. We also realise that achieving that balance requires a thorough grasp of how to write for a digital audience as well as a thorough study of a certain business sector. As a result, Arcane Software offers three content-related choices:</p>
            <div class="iconBlockWrapper">
                <div class="iconBlock"><i class="fas fa-pencil-alt"></i>
                    <h5>You Create the Content</h5>
                    <hr>
                    <p>The customer supplies all material, and Arcane Software is in charge of incorporating it into an authorised design. We'll utilise the approved web design to guide content formatting, picture resizing and optimisation, font installation, site colour setup, and website testing across a number of browsers and devices. This will drastically cut labour costs and, as a result, the client's bill.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="iconBlock"><i class="fas fa-people-carry"></i>
                    <h5>We Both Create the Content</h5>
                    <hr>
                    <p>We're willing to work with you if your business requires a combination of both choices. Arcane Software's in-house team of editors can create any material your company needs, whether it's photos, videos, or text. The costs of various services (writing, photography, graphic design, and so on) vary based on the needs of the company.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="iconBlock"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>
                    <h5>We Create the Content</h5>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Everything is created by our editors and publishers. It's a regular request that almost always produces the greatest outcomes. We create material that promotes your company as a leader after studying the industry and analysing the competition. Our <strong>writing services cost $120 per hour</strong>, and a half-day of <strong>on-location photography costs $500</strong>. If stock photos are required, we devote the necessary effort to finding high-quality images. Anyone who has spent time searching for stock pictures understands how soul-destroying it can be — luckily, we know where to get the perfect images!</p>

        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Features</h2>
            <p>Once the content has been determined, the following stage is to look at design, structure and features.</p>
            <p>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP are all used in our web development solution. Other companies typically don't utilise these technologies directly since they take longer than software like WordPress, as well as requiring more skill. Increasing the client's costs while simultaneously placing restrictions and limitations on what they may do. Arcane Software combats this by utilising pre-configured code snippets that allow us to accomplish these processes in minutes without the need for extra plugins or restrictions.</p>
            <p>But still enabling us to take full advantage of unlimited customisation options.</p>
            <div class="iconBlockWrapper">
                <div class="iconBlock"><i class="fas fa-pencil-ruler"></i>
                    <h5>Web Design</h5>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Color palettes, font styles, layout, visual design, and navigation are all included. All of our designs are fully responsive (they operate on all screens sizes) and emphasise the use of design to increase engagement and conversion rates. Our web design services are offered at around <strong>$95 per hour</strong>.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="iconBlock"><i class="fas fa-photo-video"></i>
                    <h5>Photo Source Sets</h5>
                    <hr>
                    <p>All images will be added, resized, optimised, and tagged by Arcane Software. We can show photos in a carousel, grid, paralax, or any other way you can think of. That is the strength of custom programming, as opposed to WordPress and website builders' restrictions. This cost is included in the web design package.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="iconBlock"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i>
                    <h5>Social Media Integration</h5>
                    <hr>
                    <p>We can connect your website to Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and other social media sites. It's worth noting that some social medias do take longer than other to implement and thus fees differ by social platform.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="iconBlock"><i class="fas fa-search"></i>
                    <h5>Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)</h5>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Long-term success requires a continuous SEO strategy. If your company is interested in getting started with SEO, <strong>the cost starts at $500</strong>. Page meta tags, social media meta tags, picture size and compression and code weight minimisation are all included.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="iconBlock"><i class="fas fa-search"></i>
                    <h5>Analytics</h5>
                    <hr>
                    <p>The owner of a website may use Analytics to view a range of statistics on visitors, including demographics, the medium through which they arrived at the site, user retention, popular pages, conversion rates, platform comparison, and much more. This information is included in every web design bundle and is crucial to the success of any marketing effort.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="iconBlock"><i class="fas fa-cash-register"></i>

This service is available to our hosted clients <strong>from $100</strong>, depending on the size and complexity of your site as well as the cache settings you require.</p>

                    <h5>Subdomains</h5>
                    <hr>
                    <p>In addition to numerous other services we are able to provide via our hosted services, we can divide your website into two with subdomains. If you are not sure what a subdomain is, images is a subdomain of google: <a href="https://images.google.com/">https://images.google.com/</a>.
