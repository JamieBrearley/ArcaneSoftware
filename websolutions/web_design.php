            <h2>Web design</h2>
            <p>In today's competitive online platform, getting your visitor's attention right away is critical. It's essential that your company provides an excellent first impression and encourages people to interact with and explore your website.</p>
            <p>At Arcane Software, our objective is to build and maintain websites that make our web design clients stand out. We collaborate with you to investigate your rivals and learn about your business, focusing on what sets you apart. You can't expect to stand out if your design is generic and similar to everyone else's. See the difference a well-designed website can make by looking through our <a href="../portfolio.php" disabled>client portfolio</a>.</p>
            <p>We identify the proper balance of visual components to help develop a web design that matches your business. <a href="../websolutions/website_photography.php">Photography</a>, <a href="../websolutions/graphic_design.php">visual design</a>, typography, colour palettes, and more are all part of every design project at Arcane Software.</p>
            <p>Every business should have an attractive, confidence-building website that engages visitors.</p>

            <h2>Our Process</h2>
            <p>We believe that a website should showcase what makes you, you, because no two businesses are identical. To do so, we meet with you to learn about your business and study your competitors; if you want to surpass them, you need to know what they're doing and where the opportunities are.</p>
            <div class="iconBlockWrapper">
                <div class="iconBlock">
                    <i class="fas fa-search-location" aria-hidden="true"></i>
                    <h5>Research</h5>
                    <hr>
                    <p>We collaborate with you to learn about your prefered site designs and provide recommendations that we feel will improve your site. We develop a plan to make your business attractive and compete more effectively, starting with layout, structure, graphics, headlines, and content.</p>

                    <p>Once we've figured out what kind of business you have and how you stand out from the competitors, we'll create the material needed to showcase your company as the finest in the industry. This is an optional service; if you already have the material or would like to obtain it internally, you are welcome to do so. During this step, we would also arrange for any required Photography and/or visual design.</p>
