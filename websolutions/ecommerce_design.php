            <h2><span class="fancy">Cutting edge technology</span> for the modern business owner</h2>
            <p>Why does running an online store have to be so complicated? Our eCommerce sites run tried and true systems that allow for flexible management in the ever-changing retail space. Managing an online store has become unnecessarily difficult because of how fast technology evolves with each passing year. Luckily, Arcane Software provides flexible, intuitive features for both staff members and customers.</p>
            <p>With the help of Arcane Software, you can ensure that your online business is running smoothly and effectively by giving important insights. Our tools provide real-time reporting to monitor traffic sources, trending items or quantity sold in a store. This allows for accurate reporting so that businesses know their ROI as well as get an idea of what products are popular with customers at any given time.</p>
            <p>Of course it’s equally important that you're able to extract information when needed and this is why we have provided our clients with real-time reports on number visitors per day/week; available stock levels for each product within stores (and whether they need replenishing); which pages were most visited during peak hours etcetera - all ensuring return on investment.</p>

            <p>It’s true that there are many eCommerce stores out there. But when it comes to having a store, not every site is created equal. You don't want your online shop to be just another figure on the internet landscape. It's important to make sure you have a plan for your future success by looking at both now and the future. We work with all sorts of businesses - from small owners who need a basic eCommerce store, to large multinational brands who require system-driven customization and sophisticated marketing initiatives - because we know each business has different needs that should be taken into consideration throughout the entire process.</p>
