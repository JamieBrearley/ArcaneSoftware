                    <hr>
                    <p>There are a lot of complicated technical details behind running and maintaining your own domain. We can take care of all the administrative work for you, from purchase to renewal to migration. So just sit back and relax.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>We do not have a subscription model. Don't pay us a month's worth of maintenance to sit on our hands. We charge only for the time it takes for us to update material or alter an aspect of your site. It's that simple.</p>

                    <h5>Website Hosting</h5>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Hosting on our servers means that your site is always backed up, and will always have redundancy. We also offer password-protected connections with key authentication accessible only from specific sites - preventing outside attackers.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p>Host multiple websites under a single domain name. Get custom error routeing so incorrect address will automatically route to what they're looking for, instead of frustratingly throwing up 404 errors!</p>

                    <p>It wouldn't be an Arcane Software service without total and complete customisation options. With different rules for cacheing, page access and many more, we have you completely covered. You won't have to worry about any limitations of third-party software.</p>
