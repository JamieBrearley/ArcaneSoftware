                    <p>Be rewarded for your accomplishments rather than the size of your bank account. While paid Google advertising may generate a lot of traffic quickly, your results may deteriorate as soon as your budget is depleted.</p>

                    <p>In the realm of SEO, there is no such thing as a consolation prise. With less than 1% of searchers going past page one, being on the first page of results is critical.</p>
